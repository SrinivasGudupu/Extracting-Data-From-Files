      "HOD\tDean-AIMLExternal ExaminerGENERAL LABORATORY INSTRUCTIONSStudents are advised to come to the laboratory at least 5 minutes before (to the starting time), those who come after 5 minutes will not be allowed into the lab.Plan your task properly much before to the commencement, come prepared to the lab with the synopsis / program / experiment details.Student should enter into the laboratory with:Laboratory observation notes with all the details (Problem statement, Aim, Algorithm, Procedure, Program, Expected Output, etc.,) filled in for the lab session.Laboratory Record updated up to the last session experiments and other utensils (if any) needed in the lab.Proper Dress code and Identity card.Sign in the laboratory login register, write the TIME-IN, and occupy the computer system allotted to you by the faculty.Execute your task in the laboratory, and record the results / output in the lab observation note book, and get certified by the concerned faculty.All the students should be polite and cooperative with the laboratory staff, must maintain the discipline and decency in the laboratory.Computer labs are established with sophisticated and high-end branded systems, which should be utilized properly.Students / Faculty must keep their mobile phones in SWITCHED OFF mode during the lab sessions. Misuse of the equipment, misbehaviours with the staff and systems etc., will attract severe punishment.Students must take the permission of the faculty in case of any urgency to go out; if anybody found loitering outside the lab / class without permission during working hours will be treated seriously and punished appropriately.Students should LOG OFF/ SHUT DOWN the computer system before he/she leaves the lab after completing the task (experiment) in all aspects. He/she must ensure the system / seat is kept properly.COURSE OBJECTIVES:To understand the application areas of IOT.To realize the revolution of the Internet in Mobile Devices, Cloud & Sensor Networks.To understand the building blocks of the Internet of Things and characteristics.To impart necessary and practical knowledge of components of Internet of ThingsDevelop skills required to build real-life IOT based projects.COURSE OUTCOMES:After the completion of this course, the students will be able to:Understand Internet of ThingsUnderstand the hardware and software componentsInterface I/O devices, sensors & communication modulesRemotely monitor data and control devicesDevelop real life IOT based projects.List of ExperimentsWEEK 1: Study of Arduino Boards and LED InterfacingObjective: Familiarization with Arduino and perform necessary software installation and Interface LED/Buzzer with Arduino/ESP8266 and write a program to turn ON LED for 1 sec after every 2 seconds.Study of Arduino Boards:The Arduino UNO is an open-source electronics platform based on the 8 bit ATmega328 microcontroller chip, used to build electronic projects. The Arduino can read the sensor’sPin Diagram:Arduino Uno Applications:Used in Do-it-Yourself projects prototyping.Security and Defence SystemDigital Electronics and RoboticsDevelopment of Medical InstrumentUsed in Home AutomationIndustrial AutomationDifferent Type of Arduino boards:Installation of Arduino IDE SoftwareTo start programming with Arduino, you need to install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Below are the steps for installing the Arduino IDE on Windows, macOS, and Linux.Step 1: Download Arduino IDEGo to the official Arduino website: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.Choose the version of the IDE for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).Windows: You can launch the Arduino IDE from the Start menu or by double-clicking the Arduino desktop shortcut.macOS: Open the Applications folder and click on the Arduino icon.Linux: You can launch the Arduino IDE from the applications menu or by typing arduino in the terminal.Step 4: Configuring the Arduino IDESelect the Arduino Board:o Go to Tools > Board and select the model of Arduino you are using (e.g., Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega, etc.).Select the Port:Connect your Arduino board to the computer via a USB cable.Go to Tools > Port and select the COM port that corresponds to your Arduino board.Step 5: Test the InstallationTo test if everything is working properly:Open the Arduino IDE.Go to File > Examples > Basics and select Blink.void loop() {digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(1000); // wait for a seconddigitalWrite(13, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(1000); // wait for a second}Click the Upload button (right arrow).The IDE should compile the sketch and upload it to the Arduino board.If everything is set up correctly, the LED on Pin 13 of your Arduino board will start blinking.Code Analysis:void setup() Function:Purpose: The setup() function is used for initialization. It runs only once when theThis command sends a HIGH signal (5V) to digital pin 13, turning the LED on.In this case, the LED will turn on because pin 13 is set to HIGH, supplying voltage to the LED.delay(1000);:This line pauses the execution of the program for 1000 milliseconds (1 second).delay(1000) simply tells the program to wait for 1 second before continuing to the next line of code.digitalWrite(13, LOW);:This command sends a LOW signal (0V) to digital pin 13, turning the LED off.Setting pin 13 to LOW disconnects the voltage, so the LED turns off.delay(1000);:Again, this line pauses the program for another 1000 milliseconds (1 second) after turning the LED off.The delay ensures that the LED remains off for 1 second before the next loopObservation:Week 2: Led Control Using Switch and DHT 11 Sensor InterfacingObjective: Interface DHT11 Sensor with Arduino / ESP8266 and write a program to print the temperature and humidity readings when Push Button is pressed.Components Required:Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino UNO) or ESP8266 board (e.g., NodeMCU).Push Button.DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.10kΩ Resistor (for DHT11 sensor pull-up).4.
